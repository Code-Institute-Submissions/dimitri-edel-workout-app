BUG-FIX # 1:
class: EditExerciseSet
Forsets work fine in the get method, yet in the post method they come up uninitialized.
Solution: 
add {% *.management_form %} to the three templates that the view uses for rendering

BUG-FIX #2:
class EditExerciseList
Since the URL does not use any parameters, yet the template is designed to be able to 
add new datasets to the model, I did not provide instance to the form in the post method.
Which lead to faulty behaviour.
Solution:
I store the id of the object that is used in the form in the get-method in request.session.
Then, pull the id from the request.session and use it to get an instance of the exercise,
from the model. Then assign this instance to the form.
