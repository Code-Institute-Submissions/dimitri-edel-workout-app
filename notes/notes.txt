BUG-FIX # 1:
class: EditExerciseSet
Issue:
Forsets work fine in the get method, yet in the post method they come up uninitialized.
Solution: 
add {% *.management_form %} to the three templates that the view uses for rendering

BUG-FIX #2:
class EditExerciseList
Issue:
Since the URL does not use any parameters, yet the template is designed to be able to 
add new datasets to the model, I did not provide instance to the form in the post method.
Which lead to faulty behaviour.
Solution:
I store the id of the object that is used in the form in the get-method in request.session.
Then, pull the id from the request.session and use it to get an instance of the exercise,
from the model. Then assign this instance to the form.

BUG-FIX #3:
class EditWorkout   
Issue:
The the QuerySet in the view kept coming up in a random order. As a result the editable form for
for a new exercise in the workout (type: WorkoutExercise) was one from the already existing EditExerciseSet
in this very same workout. So changing it would change one of the existing datesets.
Solution:
I forgot to erase a line of code, that I had used for creating a formset, so all the datasets were editable.
The instanciation of a formset requires a query. The query was reordering the QuerySet. I simply removed
that line from the code and thing came back to normal.
