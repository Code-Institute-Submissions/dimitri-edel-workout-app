        <h2>Keep track of progress with a personal Workout Journal</h2>
        <p>
            If you work out, it is always good practice to keep a journal, so you can <b>keep track of your results</b>
            over
            a given period of time.
            Many people will have a note pad, where they put everything down. But if you go to the gym and forget the
            note
            pad, then it might be
            difficult to memorize everything, so you can put it down in your workout journal. But for using this workout
            journal all you need is your
            smart phone with an internet connection, which you take everywhere with you anyway.

            The exercises you define are <em>not</em> for one workout only. They can be used in other workouts.

                <b>Start</b>
            </li>
            <li>
                In the top left corner is an editable field with the name of the workout. In the figure below the name
                of the workout is
                <em>chest and shoulders</em>. In the left column below the name you will see the name of the exercise
                that you chose to
                start out with. In the illustraition below the name of the exercise is <em>shoulder press</em>. Now you
                will probebly want to
                start doing the shoulder press and capture how many sets of how many repetitions, with how much weight
                you did. To do that press on
                <span class="url-link"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>Edit</span>, that is in the column next
                to the name of the exercise. <br>
