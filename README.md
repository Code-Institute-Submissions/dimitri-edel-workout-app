 If you work out, it is always good practice to keep a journal, so you can **keep track of your results** over
a given period of time. Many people will have a note pad, where they put everything down. But if you go to the gym and forget the note pad, then it might be difficult to memorize everything, so you can put it down in your workout journal. But for using this workout journal all you need is your smart phone with an internet connection, which you take everywhere with you anyway.
## First design
### Wireframe
This was the initial thought. Yet, in the process I realized that I missed out a couple of views.

### ERD
As mentioned before, I missed a few views in the intial wirefraem, which also means that the first ERD was missing one model class. However, this was the first draft.
